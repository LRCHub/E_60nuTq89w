Say hello, to the girl, that I am
You're gonna have to see

Out of my perspective
I need to make mistakes
Just to learn, who I am
And I don't wanna be

So damn protected
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in takin' chances
But who am I to say?
What a girl is to do?

God I need some answers
What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel

But my life has been
So overprotected
I tell 'em what I like
What I want, and what I don't
But everytime I do

I stand corrected
Things that I've been told
I can't believe
What I hear about the world, I realize
I'm over 'verprotected

There must be another way
'Cause I believe in takin' chances
But who am I to say?
What a girl is to do?
God I need some answers
What am I to do with my life?

(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?

(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
(Help the way I feel)
But my life has been so overprotected
I need time

(Love)
I need space
(This is it)
I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna

What I want what what I'm gonna
(I need)
Do about my destiny
(I say no no)
Nobody's tellin' me just what I wanna
(Do, do)

I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me
(Action)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)

I can't help the way I feel
(Feel)
But my life has been
So overprotected
I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I want what what I'm gonna
Do about my destiny
(I say no no)
Nobody's tellin me just what I wanna
(Do, do)
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me
What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
Oh, I can't help the way I feel
(The way I feel)
But my life has been
So overprotected
