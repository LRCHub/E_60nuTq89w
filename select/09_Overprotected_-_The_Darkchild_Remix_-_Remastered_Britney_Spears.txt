I need time (time)
Love
Joy (joy)
I need space (space)
Love
I need me (action!)

Say hello to the girl that I am
You're gonna have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't wanna be so damn protected

There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

I tell 'em what I like, what I want and what I don't
But, everytime I do, I stand corrected
Things that I've been told I can't believe
What I hear about the world
I realize I'm overprotected

There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel (help the way I feel)
But my life has been so overprotected

I need time
(Love)
I need space

I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I, what, what, what I'm gonna (I need)
Do about my destiny (I say no, no)
Nobody's tellin' me just what I wanna (do, do)
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me (action!)

(Yeah, yeah)
What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I, what, what, what I'm gonna
Do about my destiny (I say no, no)
Nobody's tellin' me just what I wanna (do, do)
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be
Someone else but me

What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
(Oh, I can't) I can't help the way I feel (help the way I feel)
But my life has been so overprotected
